continuation of simulation 16: Large network, 156 units

whatâ€™s new: 
	- use LOWER learning rate too see if converges at better point
	- previous: 0.001
	- now: 0.00001


results: 
	learning is too slow
	not realistic unless there is way of boosting the speed of convergence

Conclusion: 
so I decide to drop simulation 16.2. learning rate of 0.00001 is too low if unless there is a way of boosting the speed of convergence
