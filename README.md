<p> The speed of ultra-rapid categorization (<a href = "http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_00701#.V6ENc5MrJgo">Wu, et al., 2015</a>) has been considered as evidence for a feed-forward view of visual recognition (<a href = "http://www.pnas.org/content/104/15/6424.full">Serre, Oliva & Poggio, 2007</a>). Here, we built a recurrent neural network that captures the behavioral and neural temporal dynamics of visual recognition processes, including the rapid recognition data and several other empirical patterns. These results provide evidence that object recognition is supported by interactive processes in the brain.
