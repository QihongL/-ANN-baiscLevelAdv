# PDPmodel_Categorization

I am trying to model the temporal dynamics of human categorization behaviors, supervised by Professor Tim Rogers at the Knowledge and Concepts lab. 

It is well known that people are in general faster at basic level category verification (dog vs. non-dog), whereas information about the more general level is actually available to the mind earlier. To understand the temporal dynamics of human visual object recognition, we built a neural network model that learns concepts. Simulations with the model show that this model captures a wide range of behavioral and neuroimaging results, including the aforementioned behavioral finding.
