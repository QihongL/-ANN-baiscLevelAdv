IntroductionIf you give people a picture of a Dalmatian and ask people to name it, most people are going to say the basic level name (dog), rather than the subordinate level (Dalmatian) or the superordinate level name (animal). Rosch et al. (1976) famously pointed out that people have “basic level advantage”. Specifically, people are faster and more accurate at categorization at the basic level (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Murphy & Brownell, 1985; Rogers & Patternson, 2007). However, the studies on ultra-rapid categorization show that participants can categorize objects at the superordinate level after about 150ms after they saw the images, whereas they were unable to do this at the basic level (Kirchner & Thorpe, 2006; Mace et al., 2009; Thorpe, 2009; Wu et al., 2014). Collectively, experimental works have shown a paradox: people have basic level advantage, although they have access to superordinate level concepts first. It is theoretically important to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon. Current work:Although this phenomenon seems paradoxical, it can be naturally explained by the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) theory to semantic cognition (Rogers et al., 2004; Rogers & Patterson, 2007). Indeed, I already built and trained a PDP model that can produce different level of names when it receives the visual input pattern of an object. After training, this model naturally “prefers” to name an object at the basic level. Moreover, at the early stage of its visual recognition process, the superordinate level names are activated most strongly. According to the PDP theory to semantics, the internal representations of concepts are represented by patterns of neural activities in the brain such that similar concepts are represented by similar patterns (Rogers et al., 2004; Rogers & Patterson, 2007). If one plots the concepts on a semantic space, similar concepts should be close to each other. For example, the concepts of the Dalmatian and the golden retriever should be close to each other in the semantic space, because they are represented by similar patterns of neural activities.PDP model is a biologically inspired model composed by neuron-like unit. Every unit can only receive input activation from other units and sends output to others. The output value is a logistic function of the input value so that it will be more activated when it receive higher input values (logistic function). When the model is trying to recognize an object, the neural state gradually moves from some point in the semantic space to the representation of the object. According to the PDP account, since the region for a basic level category is embedded in the region of its superordinate level category, the superordinate level concept will be activated first. After a while, the neural state will enter the zone of the basic level category. Because the basic level concepts have greater benefits from similarity-based generalization, it will be activated much more strongly, and surpass the superordinate level concepts, as illustrated below.
