Conduct simulation on larger a network, 156 units

1. too see if the bas-sup differentiation becomes larger
2. too see if ‘-‘ all non-1 units work as expected


results: replicated previous temporal pattern and nothing really special 



TODO LIST: 
	- 16.1 lower learning rate
	- 16.2 with momentum 
	- 16.3 with ‘-’


FUTHER DIRECTION: 
	implement a linear SVM
	logistic regression w/ & w/o lasso regularizer
