continuation of simulation 16: Large network, 156 units

what’s new: 
	- use LOWER learning rate too see if converges at better point
	- previous: 0.001
	- now: 0.0001


results: at 5000 epochs, the pattern is still not converging to the pattern i saw when the learning rate is 0.001 at 300 epochs… 

NEXT: 
	1. keep training
	2. boost up learning speed
