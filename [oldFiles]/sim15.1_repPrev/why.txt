I want to fix the problem with simulation 15, i changed the seed value to 3, in order to see if the phenomenon occurs for other seed value


result 1: the model still doesn’t activate the subordinate features at all
conclusion: changing the seed doesn’t matters


result 2: found a bug in the tempDynamics.m file
	debug was done

result 3: replication was successful!
