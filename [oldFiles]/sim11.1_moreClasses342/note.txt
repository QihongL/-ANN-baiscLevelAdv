1. simulated with more basic level classes, 
	in particular, sup:bas:sub = 3:4:2， ∂ － 0.005	

	results: early sup adv. occurred, however, the magnitude of bas_adv is low, about 		the same with sup.act value. sub_act converges with bas_act. 
	Conclusion: 
	idea: try lower learning rate (DONE)




2. simulated ∂ = 0.001 
	results: ep100 & 200 -> sup_adv  +  ep500 -> sub_adv
		basic < sub very early
		i.e. no basic level advantage?!
	conclusion: ?
	idea: increase the number of sub instances
