This simulation uses the code from simulation 15. So it is a small network. 

GOAL: to tune the parameters to see what it might lead

* this folder is NOT USED for any parameter tuning experiment. it just keeps the original parameters. the experiment will be conducted in “17.x” folders

parameters to be tuned: 
	1. ways of learning and momentum 
	2. train & test groupCrit
	3. initOutput for all layers
	4. time length for each trial
